1)The sigmoid module takes an 8-bit signed input x and produces a 16-bit signed output out. 2)Inside the module, there are several registers declared to hold intermediate values. 
3)The always @(*) block represents a combinational logic block that updates the output out whenever the inputs change. 
4)f the most significant bit x[7] is 1, it means x is negative, so y is assigned the negation of x. Otherwise, y is assigned x. The value of y is then right-shifted by 2 bits, storing the result in z. 5)The value z is added to 8'b1111_0000 (240 in decimal) and stored in sum. 
6)The variable sum is squared, and the result is stored in sq. )The value of sq is right-shifted by 1, storing the result in sh. 
8)If x is negative (i.e., x[7] == 1'b1), the value of sh is assigned to out. Otherwise, out is assigned the value of 16'b00000001_00000000 minus sh.
